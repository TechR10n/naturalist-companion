    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Your assignment is to design, build, and explain a novel agentic workflow that utilizes a subset of the Wikipedia dataset. As part of this, you will need to define a distinctive GenAI use case that your system is intended to solve. The aim is to showcase not just your technical implementation skills, but also your ability to apply agentic system design innovatively and practically. You will implement your workflow in the Databricks Free Edition, starting from the provided notebook `01_agentic_wikipedia_aimpoint_interview.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started, we pre-installed LangChain and LangGraph which are open source GenAI orchestration frameworks that work well in a Databricks workspace. In addition, we have provided you with a basic setup to access the data source using a LangChain dataloader (https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/wikipedia/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use coding assistants for this assignment, but you must provide your own custom prompts and demonstrate your own critical thinking. Large language models must not be used to generate responses for the open-response questions in Part B of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This assignment uses serverless clusters. At the time of creating this notebook, all components run successfully. However, you may need to address package dependency issues in the future to ensure your GenAI solution continues to function properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reference Architecture\n",
    "    - This should highlight your approach to addressing your use case or problem in either a pdf or image format; include technical agentic workflow details here.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Databricks Notebook(s)\n",
    "    - Includes primary notebook `01_agentic_wikipedia_aimpoint_interview`.ipynb and any supplemental notebooks required to run the agent\n",
    "    - In the `01_agentic_wikipedia_aimpoint_interview`.ipynb notebook complete the **GenAI Application Development** and **Reflection** sections. The GenAI Application Development section is where you add your own custom logic to create and run your agentic workflow. The Reflection section is writing a markdown response to answer the two questions.\n",
    "    - To reduce your development time, we created the logic for you to have a FAISS vector store and made the LLM accessible as well.\n",
    "    - Before finalizing, make sure your code runs correctly by using \"Run All\" to validate functionality. Then go to \"File\" → \"Export\" → \"HTML\" to download as HTML file. Next, open this HTML file. Finally save as a PDF see instructions below. __Note: In your submissions this must be a PDF file format__\n",

Eight sports are governed by the FIG, including gymnastics for all, men's and women's artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics (women's branch only), trampolining (including double mini-trampoline), tumbling, acrobatic, aerobic, parkour and para-gymnastics.

      "== Etymology ==\n",
      "The word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective γυμνός (gymnos), by way of the related verb γυμνάζω (gymnazo), whose meaning is to \"train naked\", \"train in gymnastic exercise\", generally \"to train, to exercise\". The verb had this meaning because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Gymnastics can be traced to exercises performed in Ancient Greece, specifically in Sparta and Athens. Exercise of that time was documented by Philostratus' work Gymnastics: The Ethics of an Athletic Aesthetic. The original term for the practice of gymnastics is from the related Greek verb γυμνάζω (gumnázō), which translates as \"to train naked or nude,\" because young men exercised without clothing. In ancient Greece, physical fitness was highly valued among both men and women. It was not until after the Romans conquered Greece in 146 BC that gymnastics became more formalized and was used to train men in warfare. On Philostratus' claim that gymnastics is a form of wisdom, comparable to philosophy, poetry, music, geometry, and astronomy, the people of Athens combined this more physical training with the education of the mind. At the Palestra, a physical education training center, the disciplines of educating the body and the mind were combined, allowing for a form of gymnastics that was more aesthetic and individual and that left behind the focus on strictness, discipline, the emphasis on defeating records, and a focus on strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Francisco Amorós y Ondeano—a Spanish colonel born on 19 February 1770, in Valencia, who died on 8 August 1848, in Paris—was the first person to introduce educative gymnastics in France. The German Friedrich Ludwig Jahn began the German gymnastics movement in 1811 in Berlin, which led to the invention of the parallel bars, rings, the horizontal bar, the pommel horse and the vault horse.\n",
      "Germans Charles Beck and Charles Follen and American John Neal brought the first wave of gymnastics to the United States in the 1820s. Beck opened the first gymnasium in the US in 1825 at the Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts. Follen opened the first college gymnasium and the first public gymnasium in the US in 1826 at Harvard University and in Boston, Massachusetts, respectively. Neal was the first American to open a public gymnasium in the US, in Portland, Maine, in 1827. He also documented and promoted these early efforts in the American Journal of Education and The Yankee, helping to establish the American branch of  [{'title': 'Gymnastics', 'summary': \"Gymnastics is a group of sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, artistry and endurance.
